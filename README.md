# ImmunoMap
In order to run source code, open MATLAB and set working directory to the folder that the code was extracted to.
Run GUI by typing 'ImmunoMapQuant' into the command line of MATLAB. GUI should open and allow user to begin analyzing *tsv files created by the Adaptive ImmunoSeq Portal. 

In order to run ImmunoMap without a MATLAB installation, download .exe file from ImmunoMap/for_redistribution/ and install. This will install the MATLAB runtime engine allowing you to run MATLAB compiled executables such as ImmunoMap.
