# ImmunoMap
In order to run source code, open MATLAB and set working directory to the folder that the code was extracted to.
Run GUI by typing 'ImmunoMapQuant' into the command line of MATLAB. GUI should open and allow user to begin analyzing *tsv files created by the Adaptive ImmunoSeq Portal. If a user wants to use files that are not produced from the Adaptive ImmunoSeq Portal, one can create a tsv file with columns of Nucloetide, Amino Acid, and Counts. ImmunoMap does not require nucleotide sequences but the first column should still be present as a placeholder, however can be left emtpy.

In order to run ImmunoMap without a MATLAB installation, download .exe file dropbox link below and install. This will install the MATLAB runtime engine allowing you to run MATLAB compiled executables such as ImmunoMap.

***MATLAB/ImmunoMap requires a 64-bit architecture***
